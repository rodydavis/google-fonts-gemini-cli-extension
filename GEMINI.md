This is a GEMINI CLI extension for google fonts and material icons.

This uses the latest version of Node.js that can run files without compiling `node script.ts` and uses ESM. We need to use import.meta.url for the imports.

All the scripts are in the scripts/ directory.

Tests are in test directory and must have a .test.ts extension.
